quite general and supports user defined **Objects**. For support of custom
Objects have a look at the examples.

    raytrace(origin::Vec3, direction::Vec3, scene::Vector, lgt::Vector{Light}, eye_pos::Vec3, bounce::Int)

Computes the color contribution to every pixel by tracing every single ray.
Internally it calls the `light` function which implements Blinn Phong Rendering
and adds up the color contribution for each object.

The `eye_pos` is simply the `origin` when called by the user. However, the origin
keeps changing across the recursive calls to this function and hence it is
necessary to keep track of the `eye_pos` separately.

The `bounce` parameter allows the configuration of global illumination. To turn off
global illumination set the `bounce` parameter to `>= 2`. As expected rendering is
much faster if global illumination is off but at the same time is much less photorealistic.

!!! note
    The support for multiple lights is primitive as we loop over the lights.
    Even though it is done in a parallel fashion, it is not the best way to
    do so. Nevertheless it exists just for the sake of experimentation.
